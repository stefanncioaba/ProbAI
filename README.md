**Predict anything, anywhere, instantly.**
ProbAI is a lightweight React-based web app that lets you ask probability questions and get a concise explanation plus a single, clearly-formatted percentage answer. 
Under the hood it calls Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model via @google/genai.

## Key features

Natural-language interface – type any probability question (e.g., “What’s the chance of rolling at least one double-six in 5 tries?”) and hit ➤. 

Gemini-powered reasoning – responses are streamed from Gemini 2.0 Flash

Typewriter reveal & highlight – answers appear character-by-character, then the final percentage is spotlighted for quick scanning. 

Responsive, minimal UI – no back-end server; everything runs in the browser with Vite’s dev server.
